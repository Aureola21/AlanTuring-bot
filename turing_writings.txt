The Turing Test is a criterion for determining whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior.
A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing it was human.
The idea of a universal machine was central to my work on computability.
A machine can be said to think if it can mimic human responses in a way that is indistinguishable from a human.
The concept of artificial intelligence is rooted in the idea that machines can perform tasks that would require intelligence if done by humans.
The Enigma machine was a complex cipher device used during World War II, and breaking its code was a significant achievement.
Computability theory explores the limits of what can be computed by machines.
The halting problem is a fundamental concept in computer science, which demonstrates that some problems are undecidable.
